This repo contains the EIS dataset and trained DNN models that are described in paper titled "Serialization of electrochemical impedance spectra to forecast low frequency impedances via deep learning neural networks".
There is a simple jupyter notebook example on how to load, normlize and split the dataset, as well as how to load the DNN models.
Further files will be added depend on the process of the paper.
